Telegram bot supports the commands /help, which gives a brief information about what kind of bot it is, and /start, which
asks what movie you want to watch.

which the bot will give out the top 5 popular queries for this movie,

As a response, the bot displays the name/ year/ rating/ poster/ brief information about the film/ and a link button, by clicking on
which you can view sites for viewing.
